•	The Zoom project is about creating a video conferencing app that allows users to host and join virtual meetings. It solves the problem of remote communication by providing real-time audio, video, and screen-sharing capabilities over the internet.
•	The project uses tools like WebRTC for real-time communication, Socket.io for signaling, and Node.js for the backend. Frameworks like Express.js and front-end libraries such as React.js help build the user interface and manage application logic.
•	Result:
1.	Successfully built a functional video conferencing app with real-time video, audio, and chat features.
2.	Enabled smooth remote collaboration and virtual meetings without relying on third-party platforms.
•	Impact:
1.	Improved accessibility and convenience for users needing secure, custom online meetings.
2.	Encouraged learning and applications of modern web technologies like WebRTC and real-time communication
